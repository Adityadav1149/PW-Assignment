    <h3>
      Question 6. You are working on an e-comerce plateform. Write a javascript
      program that takes the payment method ("credit", "debit" or "paypal") as
      input and uses a switch statement to determine and print the processing
      fee associated with each payment method. For example "credit" may have a
      processing fee of 2% , "debit" 1.5% and "paypal" 3%.
